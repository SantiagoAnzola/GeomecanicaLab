## Description:
GeomechanicsLab is an augmented reality project that helps civil engineering students at the Nueva Granada Military University to understand and utilize the machines in the Geomechanics laboratory.

This project is aimed at civil engineering students at the Nueva Granada Military University who are taking subjects related to geomechanics and need to use the Geomechanics laboratory.

## Key Features:

  - Practical Section: Allows students to interact with 3D models of the laboratory machines using augmented reality.
  - Use of Vuforia: Implements Vuforia technology for image recognition and overlaying 3D models in the real environment.
  - Operation Description: Provides detailed information about the operation of each machine, including its technical characteristics, components, and applications.
  - Theoretical Mascot: Presents a virtual mascot that guides students through the theoretical concepts related to geomechanics in a didactic and attractive way.

## How to Use the Project:
**1. Installation:**
  - Download the GeomechanicsLab application on Android: üîó[^1]
  - Navigate through the theoretical section to understand the laboratory in depth.
  - Scan the available augmented reality markers below ‚è≠Ô∏è.

**2. Usage:**

  - Open the application and point the camera at an augmented reality marker.
  - The application will overlay a 3D model of the corresponding machine onto the marker.
  - Interact with the 3D model to view its different parts and obtain information about its operation.
  - Access the theoretical section to learn about geomechanics concepts related to the laboratory.
